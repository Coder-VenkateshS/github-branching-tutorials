    <h1>Git rebase & Stashing</h1>
    <nav>This is git rebase navigation</nav>

        Branching and Merging process When you do a mergin you work on different branches and then you commit and merge it
        That is you are working on a diverged branch.

        Rebase process --> You can take all the changes that were committed on on branch and just replaying
        them on the different branch. It gives a sequential or linear history But in real time it is 
        working in parallel 

        When can i use branching and merging and when can i use Rebasing process??

        IT depends on each scenario you work.
        Do not rebase commits that exist outside your repo
        Having work based on other people's work (Dependency)

        The next concept would be Stashing

        We had a problem when you switch to multiple branches without commit
